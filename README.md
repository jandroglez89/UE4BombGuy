Just a Simple Game

Hello! Jandro here, thanks for letting me take the test. I want to ask you to forgive me, but I ran into a serious technical problem, my personal computer was broken and I lost all the project. I had to restart it from scratch but in order to save some time I had to make 99% of it in blueprints. I think that I covered all the requirements of the project.

Development time:
14 hours (Originally)
12 hours (To make all over again)

From this point the next steps will be to complete IA routines (Movement and IA perception), include multiplatform (allowing to play on iOS and Android) and networking for a better experience. And, of course, model better graphics for it ;)

Thank you and sorry for all the inconvenience.
Best Regards,
Jandro.
